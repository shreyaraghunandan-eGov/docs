# DIGIT 2.0 \(30.07.2020\)

## **Release Summary:**

* DIGIT 2.0 is a baselined release that has got very few functional changes, but more of a non-functional standardisation changes.
* Functional: Introducing advance payment feature and Advance collection integration with W/S.
* Non-functional: Upgrading spring boot and tracer version of all the backend services to enhance the range of non-functional benefits like performance, metrics, and security. Also all digit services/configs are baselined to follow the Semantic Versioning. These would enable the partner eco-system, system Integrators and state teams for an easy on-going upgrades and integrations.

## Upgrade Instructions:

* DIGIT 2.0 is a baselined release - considering simplification and standardization as a theme. It is strongly recommended all state teams upgrade to leverage benefits.
  * All services versioning will follow [**SemVer 2.0**](https://medium.com/@pmuens/understanding-semver-3f75d11b4d)**,** naming conventions and Git Tagging are improved for better tracing.
  * Next release we might have few more enhancements to the services naming conventions and handling MDMS and Configs better.
* **Impact**: Functionally, the upgrade to DIGIT 2.0 should not impact the existing environments.
